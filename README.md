# weather-dashboard

## Description 

Here we have a weather dashboard. It was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. When a city is input into the text box, a fetch call is initiated and the input is stored locally. The data returned is then used in a following fetch call creating a promise chain. Data returned from that call is then dynamically generated onto the page. As my knowledge of javascript increase I plan on adding more features.
